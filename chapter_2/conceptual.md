1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

(a) We would expect a flexible method to perform better than a less flexible method. Since *n* is large, the flexible method has less of a risk of overfitting and will be able to fit the shape of the data better because it has less bias. 

(b) We would expect a flexible method to perform worse than a less flexible method. Since *n* is small, a flexible method would have a much higher risk of overfitting the data. The inflexible method would be more biased but would be able to achieve more consistent performance on such small data. 

(c) We would expect the flexible method to perform better than a less flexible method. A flexible method will be able to fit the non-linear relationships more accurately as it has a lower bias. An inflexible method will not be able to properly capture the non-linearity of the data.

(d) We would expect the flexible method to peform worse than a less flexible method. The increased bias in the inflexible method will allow it to generate consistent predictions despite the high variance. The more flexible method will likely overfit to the noise. 


2. Explain whether each scenario is a classification or regression problem, and indicate whether we are most interested in inference or prediction. Finally, provide *n* and *p*.

(a) $ \beta_0 $
